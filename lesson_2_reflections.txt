What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you use git init it makes a new repo. You still need to commit the repo.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area enabes you to control what you commit. The staging area gives you more power for controlling your commits. Maybe you made two logical changes since your last commit. But with a staging area you can still make two difrent commits.
