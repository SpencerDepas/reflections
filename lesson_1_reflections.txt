reflections first version.

Not too much to say.

using the diff command helped me find the bug by seeing the mistake that was made. This enabled me to cahnge it without looking through all of the code.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Having acces to older files could be very helpful to me. If I could find the changes in code from preveous versions it would save me a lot of hassle. Currently I do it manuely.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros, when coding we have bugs. saving at whin would prevent a save with a bug.

auto saiving could help when you forgetto commit after a long period of time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

when you are working with code, and git, and think it is more probable that you will need to go back in time and look at old files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
You can use git diff to compare any two files and it will show you the added and removed files between them . Git log will tell you what has happened in each commit.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Version control will make me more confident in making changes that might break something because I will not have to worry abou me brakeing the code and then not being able to fix it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to figure out how to use branches in the correct way to make the study group happy.
