When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This can help with sharing code with others on other computers. Also this is a safe way to back up your files so losing your local data is not the end of the world.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?


Perahps you are working on a feature that is not finished. It may interupt what you are working on.
