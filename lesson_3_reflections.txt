When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This can help with sharing code with others on other computers. Also this is a safe way to back up your files so losing your local data is not the end of the world.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?


Perahps you are working on a feature that is not finished. It may interupt what you are working on. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?


Fork
A fork is a copy of a repsoitry on github. It enables you to make changes without it affecting the orinal code. A fork keeps a refrence to the origonal file automticaklly.

Clone
A clone is a copy of a reposity. You would clone a fork or a local repo.

Bracnhes
A branch is a split in your code. The split enables you to make changes that you might not want to make on your stable version. Perhaps you want to go a difrent direction in your code but keep the origonal direction. You could have two branches.
You could also make a branch for every new feature. When it is done you could merge the branches.
